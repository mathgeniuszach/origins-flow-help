        In order to install a datapack, you must download it to your computer first.
        
        If you're on discord, you can download a datapack in the #datapacks chat by clicking on the filename (1) or button on the right (2):

        ![Origins discord #datapacks file](discord-download-datapack)
        (Also check out Nobody#0836's origins datapacks on Discord)

        If you're using the Origin Creator, click the export button in the bottom left (1), make sure "Datapack" is selected at the top (2), and then click "Download" (3):

        ![Origin creator export menu image](origin-creator-export)
        
        Click "Continue..." when you've done this if you need more help installing it.

        If your datapack is vanilla or you have the origins mod installed in your game, then you can proceed with installing a datapack you've downloaded.

        Before installing it, make sure that the zip file you downloaded contains a pack/pack.mcmeta file inside. If you only see a single folder inside, you'll have to extract the single folder inside, into the location you're installing datapacks to. Otherwise, put the zip file itself into the location you're installing datapacks to.

        Where do you want to install the datapack?

        The only thing you have to do to install a datapack in a single world is to put the datapack inside the "datapacks" folder which is present within the [world's folder](#world-folder) (click to learn where that is).

        If you did this while the world is active (you're playing it or running a server with it), you can either run the `/reload` command ingame (requires operator), close and reopen the world, or reboot the server (if you're running one) to load the datapack. Note that if the screen to select an origin doesn't show up, you may have to give yourself the "Orb of Origin" in creative and right click it to pick an origin manually (The screen will always pop up for players that haven't joined the world yet).

        You can make sure a datapack is installed by running `/datapack list` ingame and checking that your chosen datapack is listed in green. If it's gray, [refer to this (click here)](#pack-disabled)

        You can add a datapack to a world you're in the process of creating. While you're in the world creation menu, click "Data Packs" (1) and then "Open Pack Folder" in the screen that shows up (2).

        ![Picture navigating to the temporary datapacks folder](datapacks-new-world)

        Put the datapack inside the explorer window that popped up, and go back to Minecraft. You should see the datapack show up under "Available" on the left side. Hover your mouse over it and click the play button that shows up (1); it should move over to the right side. Now click "Done" at the bottom (2), and finish creating the world however you like.

        ![Selecting a datapack image](new-world-select-datapack)

        You can make sure a datapack is installed by running `/datapack list` ingame and checking that your chosen datapack is listed in green. If it's gray, [refer to this (click here)](#pack-disabled)

        Make sure you test that a datapack works on a single world before installing it to an entire modpack. You may not get proper log output if you install it to an entire modpack.

        Datapacks in minecraft normally cannot be installed across a single instance; however, if you install another mod called [Global Packs (which you can find here)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drp-global-datapack) and launch the game once, you'll find a folder called "global_packs" inside your [`.minecraft` folder](#dot-minecraft), and another folder called "required_data" inside that.

        To install a datapack for the entire instance, put the datapack inside the "required_data" folder. You'll have to reboot your game for the datapacks to load.

        If you installed the datapack to a single world, you can uninstall it by simply deleting the datapack from the "datapacks" folder which is inside the [world folder (click to learn how to get there)](#world-folder).

        If you installed the datapack across an entire modpack using [Global Packs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/drp-global-datapack), you can delete it from the "global_packs/required_data/" folder inside your [`.minecraft` folder](#dot-minecraft).
        
        If you uninstalled a datapack while running a world, you will probably need to either run the `/reload` command, close and re-enter the world, or restart the server to update it fully. If you uninstalled it from the "global_packs/required_data/" folder, you'll have to restart your game.

pack-disabled:

        If after running the `/datapack list` command ingame, you see your datapack grayed out on the list, that means the datapack is disabled.

        This can happen for a few reasons; for starters, the datapack could be made for a different version of Minecraft compared to the one you are on. It could also contain certain errors that prevented the datapack from loading properly.

        The only thing you can really try to do is to forcibly enable the datapack with `/datapack enable {datapack name}`. You can run `/datapack list` afterwards and check if it's green to see if that worked. If the command did not work, it's likely that the datapack has errors in the log, but you missed them. Go back and really thoroughly check the log for error messages, because you almost definitely missed one. You can also try uploading the log and having someone else check through them for you.

        If you are absolutely confident there's no errors in your log, there's not much you can do at this point.

        You probably didn't install the datapack correctly. Make sure you follow [this installation guide (click here)](#installing-datapacks) carefully to make sure you put the datapack in the right place. Run the `/reload` command afterwards and try again.

        If you put the datapack in the right place and things still aren't quite working right, you can try asking on Discord.

        If your issue pertains to the Origin Creator, ask [in the Origin Creator Discord (click here)](https://discord.gg/pBFqEcXvW5).
        Otherwise, ask [in the Official Origins Discord (click here)](https://discord.gg/4mTMHu3).

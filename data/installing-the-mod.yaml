        Unfortunately, you *MUST* have the origins mod installed in order to use origins datapacks. There are no workarounds; you cannot use these datapacks if you cannot put the origins mod in your game.

        You can get the [origins mod for fabric/quilt here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) and the [forge version here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins-forge). Note that the forge version isn't fully "official" so make sure to share if you're using it and asking anyone for help.

        To download the latest version of the origins mod for your game, navigate to the right version for your modloader and version of minecraft (1), and press the download button (2).
        
        If you don't see your version of minecraft listed, you may need to click the "Files" tab (3) and find the latest file that supports your version of the game.

        People have long since gotten bored of the default, regular Java Edition Minecraft as you get exclusively through the Minecraft Launcher (often called "vanilla Minecraft"), and as a result, wanted to rewrite parts of the game's code to add more items, mobs, and other behavior in general. This process is called "modding" (from "modifying") Minecraft, and any bit of code the does this is called a "modification" - or "mod" for short. A collection of mods is often called a "modpack".
        
        To make modding the game easier, several groups of people have designed special mods for Minecraft which can automatically load other mods (usually `.jar` files) into the game automatically. These are called "modloaders". There are 3 popular modloaders in existence today: forge (the oldest of the three), fabric, and quilt (built from fabric).

        Most mods today require you use one of these modloaders to use them; the origins mod is one of them.

        The origins mod requires you have a modloader installed to use it. If you don't know what modloader to pick, go for fabric. If you want to install something else, the instructions will look different. This guide will only cover fabric, but the process is similar for the other two modloaders. This process also only covers installing a modloader on a client. For servers, you'll have to look elsewhere.

        If you use a launcher like MultiMC or Prism Launcher, you can install fabric very quickly through it. While you have an instance selected (if you have no instances yet, click "Add Instance" (1) and select a vanilla version, then click okay), click "Edit" (2). Select the "Version" tab (3), and click "Install Fabric" on the right (4). Select the version with the star (5) and click "Ok" (6) to install.

        ![Picture of installing fabric on Prism Launcher](prism-launcher-install-fabric)

        If you use the default Minecraft launcher, to install fabric, first [download the installer here](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/). The installer should be a JAVA JAR file, and you should be able to double click it to run it. If that does not work, you may have an outdated version (or no version at all) of Java on your system; you'll have to look up how to install the latest version of Java on the internet.

        Inside the installer, select a version of Minecraft you want to use (1), and click "Install" (2). You shouldn't need to touch anything else, but make sure that "Create profile" (3) is checked. After the installer finishes, reboot your Minecraft launcher and change profiles; you should see a fabric profile that you can now launch!

        Also note that you have to install a custom modded server to play with friends, which this guide does not cover.

        If you just installed a modloader, make sure you've launched the game at least once (if not, just launch the game fully and then close it when it's done).

        To install the origins mod, first download it. You can get the [origins mod for fabric/quilt here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins) and the [forge version here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins-forge). Note that the forge version isn't fully "official" so make sure to share if you're using it and asking anyone for help.

        To download the latest version of the origins mod for your game, navigate to the right version for your modloader and version of minecraft (1), and press the download button (2):

        ![Modloader downloads image](download-mod)

        To install the mod, simply put it in your "mods" folder which is found in your [`.minecraft` folder (click here to learn how to get there)](#dot-minecraft).
        
        Sidenote, you'll also need to download [the Fabric API mod you can find here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), and potentially [the Pehkui mod you can find here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pehkui) for size-based origins to work. You can install these mods the same way you installed the Origins mod.

        When you're done installing everything, launch the game to make sure everything works.

        Presumably, you probably have a screen that looks like this:

        ![Fabric incompatible mod set image](fabric-incompatible-mod-set)

        The most common reason these messages occur is for one of two reasons:
        1. You're missing a mod that another mod needs in order to run, or
        2. One of the mods you're using was made for a different version of Minecraft.

        Fortunately, this problem is easy to fix, and more often than not the message will tell you exactly how. Take a look at the image again, particularly at (1). In my case, it's telling me the best solution to replace the origins mod with the 1.19.2 version. If we dig deeper into part (2), we can see more clearly what the issue is. The origins mod I have installed requires Minecraft 1.18.2 and not 1.19.2! All I have to do is delete the old 1.18.2 `.jar` file from my mods folder, and replace it with the 1.19.2 version instead.

        Your "Incompatible mod set" may say something slightly different, but so long as you read part (1) carefully, you should be able to figure out what you need to do next to solve your problem.
